INTEGRATED AICC EXAMPLE
=====================================================================
This document contains the bare minimum code required to get the AICC
library to function. It is expected that you are familiar enough with
JavaScript to add any additional JS files/code necessary to handle
other functions, varaibles, or deviations from the norm in your
particular course.

In this example, the course starts immediately upon launch (e.g. the
timer starts running), but with a little code modification, you can
delay the start of the timer (firing the aicc.startTime() function)
until after a button press or other JavaScript event happens.

  <h1>Course Content</h1>

  <p>This course it two pages, and I am using &mdash; in this instance &mdash; a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"
    target="_blank">window.localStorage</a>
    object to save AICC data from one page to the next. There are individual
    functions available that can be activated on any given page, or you can
    write your own functions to handle passing that information from one
    page to the next.</p>

  <input type="button" value="Request Credit" id="credit-request" onclick="reqCredit();">

<!-- it's expected that you'll use CSS or some other method to hide this
     form from the end-user, as there's no need for them to see it

     the <input> fields are of type "hidden", so they shouldn't show up,
     but it's best to use CSS to hide the entire form or wrap it in an
     enclosing element that's hidden just to be safe. -->

    <form class="aicc-form" method="post" target="responseFrame" action="">
      <input type="hidden" id="command" name="command" value="">
      <input type="hidden" id="version" name="version" value="">
      <input type="hidden" id="session_id" name="session_id" value="">
      <input type="hidden" id="aicc_data" name="aicc_data" value="">
    </form>

    <!-- this iframe is critical, or submission of credit will cause the
         LMS to spawn another window with result data that is irrelevant to
         the end user. However, this can be useful during development, if
         you are making changes to the code, so temporarily removing it
         could be useful for that purpose.

         You'll also need to hide this via CSS. The easiest way is to wrap
         both it and the form in a DIV or other element, and hide that one
         via CSS. -->
